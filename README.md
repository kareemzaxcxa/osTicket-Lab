## Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital world, effective communication and support are vital. Ticketing systems help organizations manage customer inquiries efficiently. My goal with this lab is to understand the ins and outs of osTicket and its capabilities. 

## What is osTicket?

osTicket is an open-source support ticket system. It allows businesses to manage support requests from customers and internal teams. Users can submit tickets via email or a web form, and support staff can track and resolve these tickets in a streamlined manner. osTicket is built using PHP and works with MySQL databases, making it accessible for many developers.

### Key Features
